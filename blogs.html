        <hr color="red">
        <p>Choosing Coding Blocks has been one of the best decisions of my life. <br><br>I could easy realise this when
            I first had a talk with my mentor. <br><br>Teaching methodology, assignments, hackathons, doubt resolution,
            everything was beyond compare.<br><br> We were pushed to explore our limits and this shows us in the success
            we achieve.<br><br> A big thanks to Coding Blocks and Kartik Mathur sir for everything.</p>
        <h3>Bhawna</h3>
        <hr color="red">
        <p>Coding Blocks is the best choice I made in my career.<br> I always dreamt of making it to the Tech bigwigs
            and after having a discussion with one of the mentors at Coding Blocks, I decided that I will go with them.
            Everyone here is so brilliant, passionate and focussed. <br><br>Coding Blocks helped me in becoming an ace
            coder and then with Mock coding rounds and experienced Industry coaches telling us how to crack various
            companies.<br><br> Wish Coding Blocks all the success in future, big thanks.</p>
        <h3>Iti Jain</h3>
        <hr color="red">
        <P>My coding journey began after 2nd year. Till then I had no clue what my future would look like.<br><br> I
            joined CB just like any other student to get a decent placement after Btech, I won’t lie it was the need of
            the hour :p and was a bit skeptical too. I didn’t know if that’s what I wanted to do, but the more time I
            spent coding, talking to mentors, and discussing stuff with peers, the more I got hooked on coding. I guess
            after that there was no turning back. I got my dream job at Morgan Stanley. <br><br>Morgan Stanley was my
            introduction to the corporate world - couldn’t have asked for a better place to start my career with. Even
            after reaching there I wanted to work for a product based company where I could work on client facing
            products and feel the rush that’s when finally TWITTER happened.<br><br> Journey at Twitter has always been
            full of surprises (I kind of like the attention now I get when I say I work for Twitter, Yes Elon musk owns
            it now) but one thing which has always grown with time is learning be it domain wise, handling situations,
            dealing with people with different perspectives etc.</P>
